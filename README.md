# Djembe Pulse

Plays simple rhythmic figures for you to improvise over, train solos 
or just use as a fancy metronome. 


Use [online version](https://evmizulin.github.io/pulse/) to play, or see below
on setting up locally.

## Setup

Use `npm install` in the checkout folder to set things up. 
Then use `npm start` to start local server and open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Deployment

Branch `master` is automatically deployed to GitHub page, 
but it doesn't build automatically. So you need to run `npm build` 
locally and commit built files to repository along with your changes.
